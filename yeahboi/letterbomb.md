# Running the Exploit

#### Requirements
- An SD card that is formatted to FAT32
- A Wii on System Menu version 4.3

!> If your SD is larger than 32GB, you will need third party software such as [GUI format](http://ridgecrop.co.uk/index.htm?guiformat.htm) to format it to FAT32.

1. Access the Wii settings. In the top right, you should see your system menu version and region. If it does not say 4.3, perform a Wii system update.
2. Select Internet, and Select console Information.

?> Do not share your mac address with anyone. Only the website to launch the exploit.

3. On a PC, navigate to the [Letterbomb Website](https://please.hackmii.com). Choose the correct system menu region for your Wii.
4. After choosing your system menu code, Enter your mac address. 
5. Check the box for "Bundle the HackMii Installer for me!" Then cut either wire.
6. This will download a `Letterbomb.zip` file. Extract it on your PC, then connect your FAT32 Formatted SD Card to your PC. 
7. Drag the Private folder, and `boot.elf` files that you extracted. You can ignore the text files.

?> If you already have a private folder, this likely houses your existing save file backups. For now, just back it up to a pc temporarily.

8. Safely eject the SD Card from your PC and Put it into the Wii. You should see a Red Envelope a few days before, the same day, or a few days later. Click the red envelope to boot into the Hackmii Installer.
