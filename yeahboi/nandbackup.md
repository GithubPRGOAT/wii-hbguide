# BootMii and backing up nand

!> Backing up your nand is very important. While it is optional, it is highly recommended

BootMii's main purpose is backing up your Wii systems NAND. With a NAND backup you can revive your Wii from a brick. This guide will detail how to backup the systems NAND.

## What do I need?

- A SD card with at least a gigabite of free space
- A PC
- A hacked Wii

?> If you installed BootMii as boot2 restart the console and skip steps 1 and 2.

1. Launch the Homebrew Channel
2. Press the `home` button and select `Launch BootMii`

## Backing up the NAND

?> You can not navigate the BootMii menus with a Wii remote. You must use the `power` and `reset` buttons or a Gamecube controller.

3. Select the icon with gears
4. Select the BackUpMii icon
    - The NAND backup will begin
    - If you see "bad blocks" they are normal
5. When the backup is complete, exit the screen by pressing any button
6. To exit BootMii press the back button
7. Store these NAND files somewhere safe on your PC or on the cloud
